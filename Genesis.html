    <p style= "text-align:justify">I started the journey as a developer years ago with lots of inconsistencies due to
        the lack of self motivation but I kept moving despite all odds. To be frank, it's been
        an amzing journey so far. I found about Dr. angela recently and that marked a huge tournaround
        because she's amazing and the pace at which I'm learning now is amazing.
        This is just the genesis,I cant wait to share more with you. Thank you!
